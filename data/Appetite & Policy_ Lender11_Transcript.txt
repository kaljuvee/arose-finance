Arose Finance  
Hey, Kelsey, right. Hello. Hi Mike. Very well. Thanks. How you doing? Yeah, all

Speaker 1  
good. Thanks. All good. Just trying to get a couple of bits sorted before obviously everyone breaks off for Christmas. Yeah, it's been a busy couple of weeks for us. I know you spoke to the guys at the show a couple of weeks ago, didn't you?

Arose Finance  
Yeah, that was it. I was speaking with very good chap. That was Taylor. Taylor, yeah, that's right. Had to kind of circled round towards the end of the day and spoke with him. It was quite interesting. Number one, could tell that you guys were switched on. Number two, the kind of, obviously, spoke to me about the revolving facility, which he finds to be quite a unique selling point. So yeah, and I'm kind of myself, it's manic busy before the end of the year. Who would have thought it'd be this busy, crazy, but doesn't

Speaker 1  
seem like it's tailed off. For anyone, to be honest with everyone I'm speaking to at the moment, saying the same thing is most people trying to get things done before the end of the year. Whether or not that happens is a different question. Obviously, everyone's reliant on solicitors, third parties, yada yada yada, but I think everyone's pretty busy. I mean, are you seeing mostly bridging at the moment? Then

Arose Finance  
I would say I do a lot of development finance and a lot of light refurb, rather than simple bullet bridging. But yeah, so I'm kind of, I think, towards 2025, looking ahead, looking to kind of grow into the development space, like refurb more, and that's probably been the majority of volumes this year as well. But yeah, it seems like a lot of lot of BDMS I speak to are BDMS and brokers are a bit burnt out. To be fair, it's the end of the year, and they kind of just absolutely knackered, but we're getting there. And appreciate your time today.

Speaker 1  
I mean, I had my, I had my first little boy in when was it June? And I'm definitely feeling out at the moment. I need it's God bless, God bless my partner. She's She's absolutely knackered at the moment. I think she's just running around doing everything. But that, on top of being a BDM is, is proving, is proving very challenging. The sleepless nights aren't fun. Put it that way, but we're getting there. We are. We're traveling on we've had a we've had a good couple of weeks in the office. We've had some nice completions, seeing a lot on our term loan. Actually, at the moment, I don't know if that's on the back of the budget. I don't know if that's on the back of people were waiting before the budget came out to sort of pull the trigger on any term facilities that being said, seeing development as well, lots of ground up, obviously, in the in the January, in the colder months, that kind of, I find it gets busier on inquiries, but slower on completions, because no one really wants to start doing work whilst it's snowing or whilst it's Frozen out there, you

Arose Finance  
can't lay foundations. Can you when it's there

Speaker 1  
exactly? See, you tend to see a lot of inquiries now so that they're ready for, sort of, I don't know, coming into February, March, when people can start digging in the earth and sort of getting the footings down. But yeah, I mean, in terms of, in terms of development, I mean, we're never going to be, we're never going to be the cheapest for you guys. We obviously serve a purpose, I think development wise, if we kind of hone on to that, one of the key things for us is regulated development. You're not going to get that away with many people. I think there's probably four other lenders that are doing it at the moment, if you exclude self build as a as a facility. But if you, if you hone it into actual regulated development, I think it's us affirmative and maybe spring that are doing it. Obviously, that has its own challenges, because you're capped off at 12 months, like every regulated bridge. But yeah, that's, that's probably one of the key selling points in the in the development side of things for us. Other than that, it's quite simple for us. I mean in terms of actual pure development, generally speaking, 70% against the gdv and no more than 80% loan to cost. And then we're going to sit somewhere around 1.05 on the cost in light refurb up for debate, depending on how much the refurb works are, in terms of what we price it at. But I mean, it's starting from point seven five, that's for, that's for really light works, and obviously a fairly chunky day one lens. So if you're talking sort of plastering and a bit of rewiring, and then you can stretch that out to 24 months. But I mean, we're, I mean, generally speaking, what I'm seeing at the moment is when they come in and they're assessed by the team, it's generally sitting at somewhere around point eight, 5.9 so we're there were there abouts against you, the likes of octane, and they those kind of guys that are really cheap and really quick with what they do. I mean, like, reefer is probably their main bag. Are you seeing more light refurb? Are you seeing more heavy and development,

Arose Finance  
I would say in terms of volume, like refurb, in terms of revenue, I would say development. So it's kind of that those are the two key drivers of the business. But I'd love to get into that a little bit more if I if I could drive for a second. So thank you very much for that. So I've got noted from formal conversation. So your minimum loan size 200 grand, up to about 10 million pounds, is that right? Strip

Speaker 1  
it, I'd say strip it back on the 10 million, generally speaking, with five being said, we can go bespoke on certain products and kind of burst that up a limit, if we're talking development that's for your real your real professional. So the guys that are not doing their first second or third, they're doing their 10th development. And obviously the pricing on that's bespoke. So it's not sort of our headline rate, it would be a credit committee decision, generally speaking, with the larger loan sizes, the rate does trickle up a little bit, so you're looking closer to 1% a month, maybe point nine five, somewhere around there.

Arose Finance  
Got it? Okay, fine. So you're not so just looking at the you very kindly populated that questionnaire for me. So just looking at that, so you're not interested in first time developers, or it's just for larger loans. You know, we

Speaker 1  
are, we are expensive. Yes, it's more the sort of the larger top policy loans. So anything above sort of four, 5 million, it's going to be your real professionals. Anything that's in our core policy first time, developers are fine, as long as they've got a strong professional team. And then that would be on our usual matrix pricing, which is somewhere around 1% a month. That's that's being reviewed as we speak. So obviously that's that's due to change shortly, and I'd imagine it would drop south.

Arose Finance  
Gotcha. Thank you very much for that. And I know you mentioned some Max loan to the value, Max loan to gdv figures earlier. I actually previously had 75% max day one loan to value and 70% max loan to gdv, which was slightly different from what you said earlier. Was it?

Speaker 1  
Yeah. I mean, it depends what product we're looking at. So if we're looking at light refurb, or if we're looking at development or heavy refurb, if it's heavy refurb, capped off at 70 if it's light, we can push it up to 75

Arose Finance  
oh, you signal it. Then if it's light, you can push up. You can push up to what, sorry, up to 75 25% and less gross, is it? Yeah, gross, got it. And on light refurb, then are you pushing up the day one loan to value at

Speaker 1  
all? Yeah, so that we could, we could go on 70 on that, but still within 80% okay,

Arose Finance  
fine. Okay, cool. Thank you very much. And I know I've got written here that you do cross collateralize, so you're the first charge on the subject purchase, and either a second legal on on an existing buy to let, or I've got here even an equitable charge, yeah, on correct. So, so I do quite a lot of that, and I know that depending on how the maths behind your cross collateralization changes, very much the net initial advance that's granted to the developer. Let's say so. For example, some are taking value of property one, which is to be purchased, and they're taking the value of property to adding them together, then subtracting the first charge that's already on the existing vital layer. Then they're overlaying a loan to value, whereas others are doing individual loan to values, you know, subtracting the first charge and the two figures arrive at different outcomes. So would you know off the top of your head how you are cross collateralizing, what maths you'd apply. We

Speaker 1  
would do it in the second instance. So we would, we would essentially have two separate loan figures when we're taking when we're taking a second legal or an equitable we don't really want to be sitting any higher than 65 sometimes 70% but we would work out it essentially our minimum amount that we would need to take out from the second property we're being offered is somewhere around 100k so as long as we're, as long as we're attaining more than 100k out of it, we're happy to we'd separate the two off. We'd then add that to the day one lend, and we essentially run it. It would run at the same time with the same underwriter. It, it's essentially worked out as two separate loans.

Arose Finance  
Gotcha. Okay, fine, under one facility document, yeah, two facility documents for

Unknown Speaker  
that one, one facility document.

Arose Finance  
Okay, cool. Thank you very much. You're

Speaker 1  
gonna end up paying stupid amounts in legal fees, and it just becomes, it becomes a pain for the client because they get confused with what they're signing. So we blend the two together, and obviously we deal with that on our side. Anyways, we're the ones that are drafting

Arose Finance  
it. Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you for that. So I've got that you do. ABM, do you ever run desktop or short form full vows.

Speaker 1  
I mean, ABM, at the moment are, they're a new thing to us. It's not something that's that's sort of in the wider policy. It's not something we're going to use on everything. Um, generally speaking, it's your lower LTV, higher. I know it sounds weird, lower, lower LTV, higher value properties, but obviously we see it as less of a risk, and generally speaking, as well, it's in the London and South East areas. So if you get a prime London and speed is of the essence, we're a low LTV or low gearing on it, we can then appeal to use a desktop, generally speaking, home track. Have you guys used home track before, yeah, yeah. Home track, yeah. So we'd use that platform, and then we'd obviously do our own comparable research in house. We've got an in house surveyor anyway, so he would, obviously, he would then review the comparables, because obviously it gives you a list of comparables in the area. But yeah, it's, it's more of a deal winner than than, sort of our standard policy for the time being, because it's quite a new thing for us. And it's, it came along with a new funding line that we took out earlier on in the year. It wasn't something that we previously did, whereas me, I worked, if you know, you probably know, I'm anyway, West one for a long time, and we were using ABM there for a very, very long time, and it was kind of standard policy for us. So for me, something that that I'm keen to see more of. But generally speaking, like I say, it comes with the higher value low LTV properties at the moment, probably roll it out soon, sort of wider policy, but that's something that's, that's kind of a new year plan for us.

Arose Finance  
Thanks. So yeah, because you're going to your funding, like you've funded, you've got three funding lines, haven't you, like Barclays, Shaw Brook, and then some high net worths,

Speaker 1  
yeah? So we've got, we've got Barclays, which is the new one, got strawbrook, which is something which we had previously had in place for quite a long time. We've got an additional funding line with another bank lender, and then we've got our investors as well. And obviously we deal with the allocation of where it goes. But I mean, it doesn't really make any difference to you guys in terms of how you structure your deals. It's more of an in house kind of thing. But, yeah, I mean it, depending on what the the actual product and the loan that we're putting forward is, it would then depict which, which line it would go through. Some of the quite few stuff, obviously, is, is dealt with in house. I mean, a recent you'll probably see on the term sheet that I just sent you, I'll phone on to term loans. For an example, it says there, obviously our max loan is 2 million. Last week I completed on a three and a half million pound apart Hotel. That's outside of policy, but it's a deal we wanted to do with that became bespoke pricing, which obviously, then was something that our in house team dealt with in terms of the funding. So we can go out of policy for the right deal. We can burst those loan amounts. It's just it has to be the right deal for us.

Arose Finance  
Yeah. Thanks, Ed. Who you privately owned by like a one or two individuals, or is it you are

Speaker 1  
family run. It's been going 30 years. So you've got Brian who started the company. He's, he's in his 80s, but he still works every single day. The

Arose Finance  
line went funny, sorry, who is that? So you've got,

Speaker 1  
you've got Brian, who is in his 80s, but he still works every single day, sharp, probably sharper, sharper than me, to be honest with you. And then you've got Jonathan, Jonathan as well, who's his son. He he runs the sales team. And then obviously some some contacts that they've got from from long, long, long before I was in the game who run the other heads of departments. So yeah, it's been going a while. It started off as developers and brokers and then kind of opened it up. But yeah, for I think it's 30 years last year, so we're coming into the 31st year next year. So yeah, we've been going a little while.

Arose Finance  
Got it. And not only that's a good because alternative bridging corporation that is, that's been, it looks like it's been incorporated in 2010 on Companies House, but I guess they've been pivoted through different brands.

Speaker 1  
Yeah, exactly. So. Used to be Southern, Southern funding group prior to that, and then a couple of rebrands prior to that as well. They, they were sort of heads of banks. That's, that's the boss's history. So yeah, opened it up for themselves. And yeah, been going since,

Arose Finance  
aha, very interesting. Thank you for that. Okay, cool. So, and then just coming back to maybe, like the the light refurb stuff, and I'm going to pick your brains on different things here, but one of the big things I always say to clients is that no two terms are made the same. So although they look identical, the devil's always in the detail, and one key way that differentiates terms is on legal fees. So one question I'd ask is, do you offer dual representation?

Speaker 1  
No, not at the moment. And that is, that's something else which has come in with the new line, but we're yet to pull the trigger on it. I think it, it's a great facility. Once again, I had it at West one. It's a great facility for speed, but it brings its own problems in house. And that being said, you really need to trust the firms that you're you're sort of instructing, if it's someone that's going to be sitting in house with you, it needs to be someone that you, you wholly trust, and you you can, you can trust, to run the whole process. I mean, generally speaking, with with any legals with us at the moment, obviously, so representation, but we'll go out for three or four quotes. We've got an open pack so we can look at, we can look at new firms on the client side, as long as it's an SRA registered company, and they've got two partners, we're happy to use them. So the market for the client is quite large, who they can use. But for us, we've got, like, I say, five, six people that we go to all day long. So Lawrence Stevens, bright stone gonna cook, joelson's j and W. There's a couple of other firms that we might use for bespoke deals that we need, someone that's got a bit more expertise. But generally speaking, they're the top five that we, we generally use day in, day out. And yeah, we've got long standing relationships with those guys. So the compliance director, his his best friend, is the director at Lauren Stevens. So hence why they're they're on panel. They generally do most of our regulated work for us and our larger loans, and then, like I say, gonna click on one that we've we've used quite a lot recently as well.

Arose Finance  
Gotcha fine. And for the faster kind of bridges, let's say, do you guys kind of either do search indemnities or overarching title indemnities? Yeah. So both

Speaker 1  
search indemnities on probably 90% of deals at the moment, to be honest with you, unless, generally speaking, the commercial deals. So commercial lending, we have to do full searches on those that being said, on the one that I just completed on the three and a half one we knew the client previously, so we were happy to indemnify on that one. But yeah, generally speaking, 90% at the time. We'll use indemnities and searches. Brilliant.

Arose Finance  
Okay, got it. And you know, if it's separate, as we've described, on completion day, you would send your net initial advance to your solicitor beforehand, we probably, I'm guessing, would have provided an undertaking to our solicitor for your solicitors legal works, and typically, that undertaking is then refunded on completion date, back to the client correct and your your solicitor will take the net initial advance, deduct their legal fee with one of two things, they'll either deduct their legal fees, or their legal fees are capitalized and added into the gross loan. That makes a big difference in terms of what the client's expecting to get the net initial advances on the decision in principle, but actually what their solicitor receives is lower than that by the order of the legal fees. So question being, do you capitalize your legal fees, or are they deducted from the net initial advance

Speaker 1  
deducted? And it just makes it, makes it makes the process a little bit smoother, I think, to be honest with you, that being said, if there's, if there's anything that that if the client would prefer it done the other way, we can always look at incorporating it in if it's something that they want us to look into.

Arose Finance  
Okay, got it. Thank you very much. So that's making note of that fine. And then in terms of your interest, again, another big differentiator is whether lenders are charging non utilization fees. So say, say, if it's a refurb loan, they thought they needed 50, they've managed to get done in 30 grand instead, um, charge non utilization, or is non used funds, the interest is kind of not charged. They're not using

Speaker 1  
exactly, exactly that the only, the only product which we charge a non utilization fee on is the overdraft, and that's charged at naught point 2% of the non utilized fee, and then obviously the discounted contract rate on the on the drawn funds

Arose Finance  
makes sense. Thank you for that, and got quite a lot of data you do revolve says is on either a first or second charge basis, 250 k up to two mil I have here. And does the borrower need to be a limited company, or can it be in their personal name against the personal

Speaker 1  
residence, it can be in as long as it's for business purposes. So this is where it gets a bit convoluted. So if it's going to be in their personal name, we need to evidence that is going to be used for a business or a business purpose. So the initial advance needs to be used for a business. I always suggest, and obviously I'm not in the I'm not in the game of advising clients, but I always suggest that a brokers is cleaner if they have an SBV set up or a limited company set up to register the charge in, because it is a business purpose loan. That being said, obviously, if it's going to go into a business that they are either directed by name or they want to buy shares into, then yes, we can secure it as only as a second charge, not as a first charge in personal name. If it's Yeah, so if it's a first charge in personal name, it would fall under regulated. If it's a first charge on their main residence, however, it's in an SPV, it would fall under unregulated. And as such, it would, it would serve purpose sort of products.

Arose Finance  
Gotcha fine. And would you lend slightly separately, but would you lend to expats on a revolving facility?

Speaker 1  
Yeah, if they've got a if they've got a UK footprint here, absolutely fine. We'd need to evidence source of wealth. So obviously, any gray list countries on the FATF list, if they're residing in those and the funds have come from one of those countries, we wouldn't be in a position to lend to them. But as long as they're not on the FATF gray list, got it and they're going to use it for a UK purpose, ie, they're not going to buy a house in Dubai with it. Absolutely fine. We just need to, we need to evidence that the funds are being used or utilized in the UK. Or if they are going to go abroad, it needs to go to a UK practicing solicitor. So if it was going to go to Dubai to buy an apartment, we need to send it from our UK solicitor to a UK practicing solicitor abroad, and they can then facilitate the purpose and do the anti money laundering checks on their site

Arose Finance  
and all of that. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay. Thank you very much for that. Fine, just dancing around a bit here between different questions that I have. So thank you for that. Okay, so if we could bring it back, perhaps to your simple bullet bridging, yeah, so I know you'll do first and seconds. Do you ever do stand alone equitables, not

Speaker 1  
really, to be honest with you, if we need it to bump up a deal, then we'll look at it similar to what we would do on development, but we're always going to want a first or a second charge on something

Arose Finance  
Gotcha. Fine. Yeah, and I know that you'll do just in terms of your valuation methodology, are you looking at kind of OMV, 180 day

Speaker 1  
open market value, all day long? Other than this is where it does get a little bit convoluted term loan, generally speaking, VP value. However, once again, the one I'll keep referring back to it, because it was quite a good deal. Actually. The other week we we managed to negotiate with credit to use the MV because they were part hotels. Think they fell under, I want to say, See, I can't remember. It was either c1 or c3 which means they were happy to use the MV on it. So there's always room to there's always room to refer and negotiate with credit. But yeah, generally speaking on our standard residential bridging, MV,

Arose Finance  
MV, and then generally speaking on commercial kind of owner occupier, commercial investment are you looking at? Did you say fake

Speaker 1  
decision, yeah, VP, unless, unless, it's a good business, in which case and they're going to trade from there consistently, we can look at, we can look at negotiating with, with credit, and see if we can bump the value up. He's in MV or MP 180 so yeah, he's always open for interpretation. It's always open for referral. I think that's probably the benefit of being a small family run businesses. You you can walk into the director's office and see if there's something we can do to win a deal.

Arose Finance  
Yeah, like the way you guys work, it's very it's direct. Is effective. So and obviously that must be top down. I can imagine the two people, I suppose yourself, obviously tailor you deal in a certain way, which, yeah, it's effective. I like it. So, okay, got it, and your valuation panel is it VAs and methods? Yeah, correct.

Speaker 1  
And then if it's a high value property and we need a red book valuation on it, will go out for bespoke quotes, same with commercial so generally speaking, you're talking Mike, Frank Saville, Chrisman, Wakefield, Stratton Park, are hm Rafferty, and then if it's a part, if it's a part, hotels or hotels, will go out for bespoke quotes, people that we think would be suitable. So Connells and some of the other guys that went in those areas,

Arose Finance  
yeah, gotcha. Okay. Thank you very much for that. And then, you know, God forbid we, hopefully we never come across this circumstance. But if there was an instance where, like, refurb client has a sale, exit, markets, crap, they need to extend kind of, what's your extension workflow,

Speaker 1  
1% extension fee, and then 1000 pound admin fee, because obviously the guys have to deal with all the legal work on the back end. And on that instance, they've got an asset management and portfolio management team that will deal with them throughout the construction. And I've got one at the moment. Actually, it isn't, it isn't their issue. It isn't their problem. The client, they they were really unlucky. They were building a unit in a really, really tight gap had a bit of an issue with a party wall agreement. It pushed back the construction by three months, and then they now need three months on the back end of it. But our servicing team and our asset management team, portfolio management team, they had the extension agreed for them, I think it was last month, so that they didn't fall into, say, a month's worth of default. So, yeah, those guys are hot on it. They set reminders anyway. So our servicing team always set reminders for clients at three months, six months, nine months, 12 months, and so on and so forth, so in three months increments, just so that the clients know where they're at to with the facility, because it is easy to lose track of it. If you're a developer or even a small time refurbisher, you can lose track of when you took a facility out quite easily, and before you know it, that 12 months has come up and you're none the wiser. Obviously, certain lenders in the market at the moment don't inform clients until it's it's sort of a couple of days before, and then it's like, oh, okay, you fall in it. You're falling into default next week. We don't want that. We don't want a book of defaults. We want a book of people that have redeemed and then come back to us again in 12 months time to do the next project. And that's what we see most of to be honest with you, is repeat offenders. They they do a refurbishment, they complete it, they come back. Same with the overdraft. People will use the overdraft to buy, say, two properties at auction. They'll refurbish them. And instead of selling them on, they might retain them and secure another overdraft against those two to do it again. And that's where we can we can cross collateralize the the two facilities and mold it into one firm, if that's what they want to do. Or they can run and they can run them separately and redeem the first one and then obviously move on to the next one.

Arose Finance  
Brilliant, brilliant. Okay, that all sounds great. Thank you for that. And okay, and in the worst case scenario that they do default, knock on wood. We never have one of those. But how does your default process work? What's the default interest? 3%

Speaker 1  
after, obviously, after they've had their their initial warning, what happens is, so obviously I mentioned, we go three months, six months, nine months, 12 months. At 12 months, our servicing team will contact them and see if they need any forbearance or if they need any help. Obviously, with anything else which is going on their background. IE, I've got a sale, agree, Michael, but the the buyers, buyer has had an issue with their mortgage or whatever, and we're going to need another three months at that point, that's where the forbearance kicks in. And the guys can obviously have a conversation with them about extending prior to going into default, because we don't want cases going into default. No, anyone does, yeah, if, if it does get to the point, because you do get it, some people just bury their head in the sand and they they don't answer you, they don't answer a calls, they don't answer letters or emails, like I said, falls into 3% default interest. And then obviously we go through the legal proceedings, which, which no one wants. And that's obviously the recoveries process for getting our money back at the back end of it.

Arose Finance  
Yeah, yeah, okay, makes sense. Thank you very much for that. Okay? And in terms of your arrangement and exit fees, I've got you've got no minimum term. But how does that work for you guys, please. So

Speaker 1  
in terms of our arrangement, fee, generally speaking, 2% across the board. With new leaf, we pay one and a half percent away. Exit fees are dependent on what product we're looking at, so if we call it like refurbishment, we won't charge an exit fee on that. If it's heavy refurbishment, likely, probably 1% depending on if it's a deal breaker, we could drop it down to somewhere around half a percent on actual development, so ground up and fully heavy refurb, you're looking at 1% active fee, same same arrangement fees as mentioned before. On our term loan, there's no early repayment charges. So okay, they could take they could take out a three to five year facility, but in year two, their books have improved and they're able to go high street. We're not going to charge them an early repayment charge for that. And there's no exit fee on that facility, and on our standard bridging there's no exit fees across the board.

Arose Finance  
Got it? That's brilliant. Okay, thank you for that, and you're you're on development. So some lenders will require a minimum director's contribution someone, obviously you're senior lender, you'll go up to 85 cent growth loan to cost developers may want to raise behind you guys. First question is, are you fine with them raising behind you? And second of all, if they do raise behind you, what's the minimum directors, you know, hurt equity or hurt cash requirement in the deal?

Speaker 1  
We don't really have a minimum amount in terms of, in terms of the other funders, or mes funders sitting behind us absolutely fine. We would prefer they contacted us and we see sight of the terms, because obviously that's going to impact the profit from the deal. Generally speaking, regarding profit, we want to see somewhere around 15 to 20% but in terms of equity contributions, there isn't a minimum amount.

Arose Finance  
Got it? Okay, fine. And I guess you'd be happy to cross collectise on developments too. I did one recently. Yeah, was a ground up. And for that, I was able to achieve 100% of the loan to cost so but yeah, and there was no there was her equity, and there was planning uplift. So in a way, there was a contribution from the clients, but it was 100% of their costs associated there. And your your max terms on, on development finance. How does that look for you guys?

Speaker 1  
2024 months, unless it's regulated, which is 12 months. Um, so yeah, 24 months. And then when it gets to the point that they're closing in on practical completion, they're nearly there if they need a few more months to get things done, and they've fully drawn the facility, but it's just a case of, we're we're now getting to the point where people are making offers, but we're going to need a few more months. We can flip them on to a straight bridge. I did a development exit in Essex. Do you know, fobbing in around that way? So I've done a I've done a 3 million pound development exit there last week, which was one that we helped with the construction of as well. So we can full circle it. And in that instance, what we do is our servicing team will let us know that it's come to an end. They'll let us know that the development's successful, but they're going to need a few more months to exit. They're still planning to sail, and they're still planning to get rid of those properties via sale. We will then contact the broker, and we'll let them know that we're looking at setting up a new facility, and it will be same as the original process. So we charge up 2% we give you one and a half percent, we'll retain one. We'll retain point five. Sorry,

Arose Finance  
gotcha okay, but and on development next year, you still going up to the same was it 75% gross loan to value? Yeah, 75% gross got it at IMV. And then do you have a kind of maximum term that you go up to there again. Yeah, got you fine. And then the maximum loan, loan on development,

Speaker 1  
exit up for negotiation again. I mean, generally speaking, we would prefer to keep it under five, because that's where, obviously, once it goes above that the price and skews a little bit. But yeah, somewhere, I would say, probably somewhere around five. The one that I done, the other the other week, like I say, was around 3 million. And that was, that was obviously headline rate, headline policy. So that one went straight through. But when we start getting to the higher levels, that's when we need to look at Bespoke quotes and bespoke lending,

Arose Finance  
yeah, gotcha fine. And in terms of rates on something like that, you're around the 1% mark or

Speaker 1  
so that one last week we charged point 825,

Arose Finance  
okay, great. So

Speaker 1  
good rate, good rate for the customer, good rate for us. I mean, generally speaking, it would fall into residential bridging. So the headline rate on that would be point seven, five. So there's always, there's always things that will be added into the matrix to impact the pricing. So for argument's sake, if there's any adverse on any deal, any deal at all, we're generally going to put between five bits and 10 bits on it, depending on how heavy the adverse is. If it's all cleared and it's all settled, and we haven't got to worry about it, then, then we won't rate loads. That being said, as well, if we, if we're tipping on the top policy, and we're, we're on the top policy on loan, size and LTV, there'll probably be some rate loading for that as well, just because obviously it's a heavier risk for us. But yeah, I mean, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to give a secure rate on everything. That's why we always say to what my I mean. So I'll give you an idea of my general process. You would come to me with an inquiry. You would outline values, client, any issues in the background, and what they're looking for. I would then come back to you with where I would be on the rate and where I'd be on the gearing. And then if you're happy with that, I would then go ahead and issue terms. I don't like issue in terms, just for issuing terms sake, and then I get the full application in, and I get the full picture in, and I have to amend terms, because you've already gone and presented that to your clients, so it's a difficult conversation for you. So I always, always give you a bit of an idea of the pricing, and then see if you want to go ahead with with heads of terms before I issue them, because otherwise you get into that situation where you just going round and round in circles, and we might think the deal looks like x, but it comes out looking like y. And I don't want you guys to have that conversation with your clients, or I want it to be sort of streamlined through this is where we are, and this is what we do, and this is where we're going to be on the right.

Arose Finance  
Yeah. 100% I appreciate that absolutely. The amount of times where I'd one recently, it was actually as a beautiful care home, care home conversion. Excuse my phone, care home conversion. And it, you know, actually it's a fantastic deal. So basically, they're buying at 1.45 mil spending 170 grand on it, and it's worth 2.8 gdv per the valuation reports at the end of it. So no brainer. They bought it. Well, they exchanged pre planning, achieved planning, massive planning uplift. So it was BMV, real, true. BMV with 170 grand spent on it, and they're making the guts of over a mill. Um, and you think it'd be easy to articulate to lenders and for the lenders to grapple with it, but they just wanted, you know, one lender in particular just wanted the what the scope of works, to be more like a million pounds, and we could turn it into a 5 million pound, you know, which is not what the developers were offering. It's not all they wanted to do. So they tried one developer tried to change, and dragged us along for seven months trying to change the scope of works. Eventually we placed it with fantastic cars or Trust Bank, to be fair to them, very good team, and managed to get it with eight 90% net loan to value for the day one. Yeah. So they were able to give us, we complete in the end with 70 grand to make. So this was 70 grand to make, like a meal. So absolute cracking deal, yeah, yeah, with that, but we did have an instance of that. So cracking deal, developers are over the moon, but it was issued on some terms, and then at the end, when the underwriters had fully looked in, it had to go on to a different product. So it was a slight rate adjustment, which puts me in a very difficult one, especially when it's time constraints. We had to complete in five weeks. Yeah, so very time constrained, few days before completion. Actually, we've got the offer back in. We need to change the rate. How do I articulate that? Luckily, they've been excellent up until, you know, because it because developers just think these lenders are just Yeah, screwing us last minute, you know, because we can't, because they can, which is not how everyone thinks, yeah. There are some lenders that are like that. Some lenders basically are looking at buying developments on discount. You know, they're looking what loan to value would we be happy to buy, buy this property at which is how you want to steer developers away from but, yeah, so it's difficult, and I appreciate you giving the kind of indication early on. And then obviously, if we can improve it absolutely we should, so that that helps for sure. And then just just your arrangement, fees and procs, are they on the gross or the net facility gross?

Speaker 1  
So yeah, we'll pay, we'll pay away one and a half percent of the gross to you guys. I think with you being New Leaf, it goes, it goes directly to New Leaf, doesn't it, and then they distribute it out. I've had a couple of completions with with some of the other guys this year.

Arose Finance  
And obviously, who have you worked with? Do you remember

Speaker 1  
Andrew at kentings, quite a lot. I've dealt with him quite a few times. The guys over at Ramsey and white quite a bit. Yeah. I mean, for me, good out for those Yeah, very good guys. I mean, I only took over the New Leaf account, sort of middle of the year. And then, like I said, my, my little boy came, so I had a month or so off. But there's a big there's a big group of you guys, obviously, in conversations with Mark to try and get hold of the Golden list of everyone that's, that's kind of on there, and that's, that's a, that's a story for another time, because you guys used to have the, remember the group chat on WhatsApp with, with all of the brokers in and then it got kind

Arose Finance  
of brokers, yeah, because someone did, we've got one, we've got, we've got one back, but just with, just with The actual ourselves. Yeah, I think someone said something about regulated and then the whole thing had to be basically shut down. But, yeah, no, it's, well, I tell you what new leaf has traditionally been a regulated residential and buy to let term network and Mark's really pushing the specialist finance lens of it. And I would say that there's a few key people that are driving the specialist business at New Leaf. I'm one of them. You've got also, you know the Ramsey and White Team Dean the machine, as they call him, over there. Don't if you've dealt with him, but him, and there's probably because he has this massive leader board that you like. It motivates everyone with once a week. And I'd say the top 10 are some of the names that you've mentioned there and including but that they're the ones that are driving specialists. And then you've got, you've got a load of people that are doing the kind of sub sub, 150k a year banking. So you've probably got like two, 300 people, but I guess for you, for you, you know, the more that you can see, the better. So, yeah, so good, good luck. Yeah, I think you do well. A lot of what some lenders will do is they'll come and they'll speak on kind of like a specialist master class, and they'll speak about your USPS and stuff. So that can be good to get yourself in front of everyone. So just your top of mind, yeah, because

Speaker 1  
for us, if we, if we start seeing so obviously, we've got, we've got sort of two or three key brokers from New Leaf at the moment, if we start seeing 5678, 10, brokers that are consistently coming to us. That's when we have the conversation with the sales directors and go, Look, we're paying these guys 1.5 on the deals. We're now seeing a significant uplift in in obviously, what they're sending over to us. What can we do for them, either on rate or what can we do for them on procuration fee? What can we do for them on sort of bespoke products? And that's where you open up sort of another avenue in terms of we can now do this for you guys, because we're seeing a significant amount coming through. So that's another sort of beauty of of being a small, sort of scale lender, is you can have those conversations with the team and go look there. They're a key contact for us. Let's, let's sort of do something for him to keep it that way. And like I said, everything I've seen from from all of the guys at New Leaf has been really, really, really good stuff. And the over at Kenton's, especially, he knows his he knows his trade, and he's got a massive client book that is sort of 3040, years strong, and every deal I've seen from him has been been top dollar. And I'm assuming it'll be the same way with you as well. So it's, it's something that I'm, I'm king, sort of open up a bit more in the new year. And I think I used to deal with Inari there. She used to deal with all of the sort of booking of the commercial day, because then you do a commercial day or something like that blender, yeah,

Arose Finance  
there's, like a, there's a commercial, like onboarding, with, like, mandatory training if you want to do commercial business. So, yeah, there's that, which is all the new joiners into the kind of to want to do more commercial. And then they have, like, Monday, they have like, monthly, sorry, weekly sessions on like a Monday, where it's like commercial conversations. There's so much to get involved, because obviously, as a network, you need to be seen to be doing training, so they're always open to those sort of contributions. But yeah, I might start thinking, so I'm scaling my business at the moment. So we're all, we're all ARs and some, some people just want to be one man and band. Some people, like Ramsey might want to scale into teams. I'm scared very much scaling in my team at the moment, but there's a whole load of training optimizations, I think. Yeah, so, so, yeah, definitely get involved in ary Sharma, you know, she helps out for sure. Mark, very much. You know, heads up the commercial stuff. So, you know, if you said to him, for example, had a really good conversation with with Kelsey or or Andrew or whatever, would love to get more involved. Can I come on one of your Monday sessions and add some value, even if it's 20 minute, you know, just get you in front of everyone. It's probably like, I'd say, on average, 70 or 80 brokers that join those sessions a week. So, yeah, so, and these are people that are like, growing their specialist business, so it's where you want to be.

Speaker 1  
Yeah, perfect. Well, look, thank you very much for your time. It's been a it's been a pleasure, and hopefully learnt a little bit about us guys, we'll see the inquiries flooding through.

Arose Finance  
Yeah, no, absolutely. It's, as you say, on the development side, it's a bit quiet, I would say, because no one's really starting. Hopefully in January, get the kind of inquiries come back in. Again, I've got a couple of developments that are just over the line in November, so they're getting going. And then the ones that are in, I don't think anyone's doing anything new now, but they're trying to get their existing ones over the line. But definitely 2020, 500% and maybe you London based here?

Speaker 1  
Yeah. So I'm, I'm North London, but I cover south eastern Essex, traditionally at West one as well. Essex was my pageant. Where are you based again?

Arose Finance  
So my, I've got family home in SCX, but I'm based in London myself. Okay, so, yeah, hopefully we get a deal over the Lima grab, grab a coffee or something like

Speaker 1  
that. Well, look, thank you very much, and I will, I'll talk to you in a new you have a lovely Christmas?

Arose Finance  
Yeah, you too. Have a lovely Christmas. Mike, Take care later. Bye, Bye, Bye.
