Unknown Speaker  
Hmm, Hi, Nick, how you doing? I can tell you on mute. I believe

Speaker 1  
what basic mistake. Yes, I'm very well. Thank you very well. Yourself.

Speaker 2  
Good. Glad to hear it. Listen. It wouldn't be a team's call without something going wrong. So, yeah, I'm good. Thank you. Let's hope so. If that's the worst we've got, we've done well.

Speaker 1  
Yeah, good, good. Thank you for your invitation. Anyway. Um, Harriet is joining us. You just send some IT problems with messages, but she'll be worth in a couple of minutes.

Speaker 2  
No worries at all. No. Yeah, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I perhaps whilst Harriet is joining, I believe he said, or Harriet, Harriet, or Harriet

Unknown Speaker  
Harriet is, is Harriet perfect?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, so I don't know it might be worth me spending 30 seconds or so explaining a bit about our background at arose, and maybe a little bit about myself whilst we wait. That'd be helpful. So most interesting to mention, perhaps for the longest time, most of my life, I've been pursuing a career in football, and then pivoted my life women's football has gone bananas now, funnily enough. But yeah, pivoted my life really into education. Last Five Years, a bit of stock trader at Goldman Sachs and left because I didn't really see daylight there. And was a property investor myself. Wanted the relationships directly, really with lenders, to see what creative structuring we could do. And now, since established Arose Finance about two years ago, and I think that might be Harriet joining Hiya. Harriet, how you doing? Oh,

Speaker 2  
can you hear us? Okay? Hi, yeah. Hi, pleasure to meet you. Yeah, so I was just in the middle of kind of introducing Arose Finance, but yeah, was born about two years ago, and we find ourselves really partnering with professional investors, portfolio landlords, professional developers, I would say in terms of our split of revenue, the key driver last year was development finance and also light refurbishment finance, conversions of existing units. Our entry point is usually on portfolio landlords, people who have 10s or hundreds of buy to lets and should be really thinking about their portfolio as if it's a stock portfolio. Really, they're inherently short interest rates, relatively short duration, long inflation. How can they hedge that out of their portfolio, if necessary? So that's where we were born. And I think the only other thing I'd mention is we just found out that we won the best newcomer to the industry for 2025 with two different awards bodies, which is a little bit fickle, but it's a rubber stamp of approval that helps with clients sometimes. And I think on the back of that success of last year, there are a handful of lenders that we don't have open lines of communication with yourselves being one of them, and I wanted to set up this meeting, really, to get into the nitty gritty of your appetite and criteria. If that suits you, sure, sure.

Speaker 1  
So what sort of stuff do you normally see? So we're bridging and development finances, you know. So what do you normally see within that sort of market?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, within development, a couple, I can mention a couple of completions in the last two months or so, or two months prior to Christmas, I had a care home conversion in Marlborough. So number one, the common it was the purchase price was agreed at one and a half million, and that was prior to planning being obtained instead of enacting the extension of the care home by 18 more bedrooms. The developers had decided to convert it back to two its original usage, two residential luxury Victorian houses, two developers title split upon completion. Sale exit. Gdv of those 2.8 on one and 2.9 on the other 1.5 purchase price planning was obtained. They kind of exchanged, got planning, and then prior to completion, we were able to include that enhanced planning uplift. And in the end, I paced that with Castle Trust Bank, who were able to give us 90% net loan to value, which was a fantastic solution for that client. So that's one the month that was in December that completed in in November, I had, well, had a client come to me in October, panicking. They had completely exchanged on a plot of land before exchanging with their investor. And so their investors, since pulled out, they'd put down their deposits, and they had 30 days to the mandatory completion deadline, 10 days mandatory notice period. So really it was 40 days, but no senior lending and no investor. So for that particular deal, I brought in an investor of mine. We actually cross collateralized it, by which I mean first charge on the subject site, equitable rather than second legal charge on existing. It was like a HMO cluster flats in r1 in ready, and we're able to, through extracting that equity, construct a 100% loan to cost ground up development in Norfolk of three units. So that's, that's another thing that was all within 40 days. The investors, of course, had to be out of country during those 40 days. And we were, I was looking, at one point, flying over because we needed the wet signatures in hand at the solicitors. And I was like, it's going to be quicker for me just to fly and because I can guarantee delivery of these documents, I didn't have to in the end, luckily. But there's, there's a couple of deals that might give you an insight to the type of things that we're structuring. Yeah,

Speaker 1  
yeah. Good. Harriet, do you want to talk about our bridging and development finance and our structure, pricing, how we work, how that would fit in with everything that Kelsey

Speaker 3  
said, yeah. So we can do residential or commercial bridging and development finance. We Yeah, we'll look at most things really bridging is tends to be around 1.1% interest per month, 2% in 1% out, whereas developments 1% in 1.25 per month and 1% out

Speaker 2  
got it? Yeah, cool. And how are you guys funded? If you don't mind me asking, it's all private funding, private funding lines got it. Okay, fine. And obviously

Speaker 1  
Kelsey being completely privately funded, not having institutional lines or anything like that. We're not beholden to any other very, very large third parties that dictate how we operate, our lending book and everything like that. So it does mean that we can be incredibly flexible, incredibly quick on how we do things.

Speaker 2  
I was going to ask you, because with some lenders I speak to, if they like the deal, that's not enough the funding line the credit committee, have to like the deal. So does that private funding line give you discretion if you like the borrowing profile or the property profile? Can you lean into deals where you need to?

Speaker 1  
Yeah, we've got absolute discretion in terms of how we do things. So something that I thought the other day, because I was talking to another funder, believe it or not, who, who is funded by shorebrook, and he was telling me about and I sort of thinking, well, you're almost just like a franchise of shoreb Blink. Break policy dribbles down to what they do, and if they want to extend a loan, then they have to ask their permission. But we are, because of that private nature, we can do whatever we like, basically,

Speaker 2  
totally agree. I call them franchise lending, which is, no, it's not disparaging at all, but it is just white labeling someone else's constraints Exactly. Right? Yeah, got it. Okay, cool. And in terms of placing you in the market, I know nothing really about you guys. Should I be thinking of your loan book in the kind of zero to 50 million pounds, hundreds of millions, a billion? What kind of size are you guys? So

Speaker 1  
our loan book at the moment is about 60 million pounds. We've got aspirations to grow, obviously, as everybody does, but that's where we sit, 60

Speaker 2  
million, okay? Well understood, fine. So you're bridging, bridging and development is where you guys sit, and that's across both resi and commercial based assets,

Speaker 1  
regulated and unregulated as well. Okay, not

Speaker 2  
one of the few regulated non bank lenders. Yes, there's many of you. It

Unknown Speaker  
keeps us very busy.

Speaker 2  
Okay, no, and that is because you find the insolvency rate of regulated loans lower than unregulated. Or why do you guys like to be in regulated space?

Speaker 1  
Um, it's not driven by insolvency rates or anything like that, because, because we take investment from high so basically, so we're not a peer to peer lender. We we take money from high net worth individuals, pull it into a fund and lend it ourselves. In order to take those investments, we are required to be SCA regulated, and going for SCA regulated lending was just a part of that process. It's not an area we've had any problems with bad debts at all. So it's not, it's not something we're looking to move away from. But I suppose that was what I've driven for, is the requirement to be regulated for investments.

Speaker 2  
Got it well understood. Thank you for that. And so just if I could dig into then to regulated bridging, unregulated bridging, you'll obviously offer standalone first charges. Do you offer standalone seconds or equitables as well? Harriet,

Speaker 3  
so we can do second charges. I'm not sure about Nick,

Speaker 1  
yeah. So we can, we can do second charge lending. The honest answer is, we don't particularly like it because you're so beholden to the first charge lender, equitable charge, not really first legal charge only is what we would be considering we might take, like an assignment of the first legal charge, but equitable probably not really. We need to be registered. The land registry

Speaker 2  
got it well understood. Okay. Thank you for that. And that context I described earlier, of cross collateralizing, is that a structure that you would be open to? So in the

Speaker 1  
cross collateralization, you just, you described you, you were taking assets over multiple properties. Is that correct? Yes,

Speaker 2  
it was first charge on one site, and then the supplemental was all second charge.

Speaker 1  
Yeah. So like, so like, so, as a definition, I would understand cross collateralization to basically be something like two or three loans secured against, like, a single property, say, or where you've got, say, multiple loans against multiple properties that all sort of cross into each other. That's how I would sort of define that. But I mean, yes, we can, I mean, we can take, we can blend first and second charges. So we did a 1.5 million pound development deal not so long ago, which was a first charge over the site, but they were a little bit light on cash, so we took the charge over there, sorry, a second charge over their multi million pound residential property, which had a very modest first charge on and we just sort of took that as a comfort child, I suppose. Does that answer your question there?

Speaker 2  
Yes, it does, yeah. And when you say comfort, were you assigning value to the primary residence charge you took there? Or was it didn't necessarily increase the loan, you know, the loan that you're able to lend, it just gave you comfort to lend where you were lending. So

Speaker 1  
for our for our own internal security calculations, we did apply like a written down value to that second charge. So when we looked at it like for monitoring, for drawdowns, it was included within those figures. However, we took the position that any enforcement would be incredibly difficult, and it's not something we would ever want to call on. So we took it like I say. That's why it was for comfort. But yeah,

Speaker 2  
in reality, seizing it would be expensive and probably not. The first

Speaker 1  
charge was like a high street bank, and I'm sure they procedures about any sort of enforcement against their first

Speaker 2  
charges, so one understood, okay, cool, thank you. And then back into the kind of weeds of your lending policy in terms of minimum and maximum loan size, and then minimum and maximum terms for regulated and unregulated bridging. Where do you guys sit, please? So

Speaker 1  
on both of those. So, so we don't have any minimum term as such. So Harriet and I were in the office on yesterday, Harriet, wasn't it, and we were talking about somebody that wanted the money for two weeks. And in theory, that would be fine, but we would want, say, a minimum of interest charge to make it worth our while. Because obviously, if somebody takes the money and pays that quickly, then you know there needs to be so we might put in, say, a three, four month minimum interest charge on something like that. So I suppose no minimum term, in that sense, maximum term probably two years. But for unregulated we'd struggle to go any longer than that. And legally, we're not allowed to go any longer than 12 months on a regulated loan. Yeah, well

Speaker 2  
understood, by the way, if I'm looking away, I've got a like, almost like a cinema screen for a screen, so I'm still, I'm not looking away, I'm still looking at the screens. So okay, well understood fine. And on your in terms of loan sizes, where, how should I be thinking about you guys?

Speaker 1  
Again, we're driven by the return that we can make on a loan. So I mean absolutely, technically, the minimum we can do is 100 the minimum I've done personally, 125, realistically with where we are at the moment in that we're absolutely not shy of inquiries. We're probably not looking for much under 200,000 and the maximum would be between three and a half to five, something like that.

Speaker 2  
Okay, got it fine, fine. And then your loan to value constraints. Where can you

Speaker 1  
go? Absolute maximum of 70% at expiring, so we will allow a higher loan to value at incept the inception of the loan, if they're going to service the interest. But if not, at the start, we're looking somewhere between 60 to 65 typically

Speaker 2  
got it. Do I infer from that you're rolling your interest

Speaker 1  
so on unregulated they can roll or pay the interest on unregulated, sorry. And then on regulated, they must roll the interest.

Speaker 2  
Must roll the interest. Okay, got it. And you're never, you're never retaining therefore, is it service or rolled on unreg?

Speaker 1  
Yes, that's right, yeah. We don't, we don't do any sort of retained interest or anything like that. And all of our fees are based on the net loan rather than the gross loan. It it makes things a lot simpler to explain,

Speaker 2  
yes, and it's fairer, actually. So yes, being charged

Speaker 1  
on your eyes in the office the other day where we were, we were being compared against somebody else, and I think that our interest rate was fractionally more expensive than theirs, but theirs were on a change interest basis. And then when you worked it out and compared it properly, they worked quite a lot more expensive than we were, because it was all hidden in clinical calculations. But yeah, it's just it's easy and it's straightforward, which, which works very well for

Speaker 2  
me. It's cheeky. I tell you what's cheeky. The retained interest is an industry standard, but you're being charged effectively interest on your interest, and equally, when your arrangement fee is being grossed up on your interest. It's cheeky and so but unfortunately, a lot of people representing the products brokers don't understand. They won't articulate the fact that you're cheaper even if the rate is higher. So that's an education piece, I guess. Fine. Okay, well, well understood. And then in terms of, we spoke about loan to value, so 70% growth at expiry there the value itself. Are you always conducting full valuations, or can you offer AVMS, desktops or short forms?

Speaker 1  
So it depends where it is really so. So we are South West based, so our offices are in Exeter, but we've also got an office in Bristol as well, if it's somewhere that's local to us and it's an area that we've got expertise. So basically, the southwest of England and South Wales, we will do our own assessments and our own valuations at no additional cost to the borough. So Harriet is herself a Ricks charter surveyor, and we we lean into her knowledge very regularly for assistance on property related property matters, loan drawdowns, things like that. Where it's slightly further afield, we are happy to accept either, depending on the merits of the case, another valuation, one that's been done with the lender. If it's a slightly more contentious case or a slightly more marginal I'd say we accept the readdress valuation if there's none in its area, if it's a house in Newcastle on a side road, it's supposed to be worth loads, but we can't verify it, then we would just go for either a desktop or a full valuation, depending what's needed.

Speaker 2  
Got it okay? CO Thank you very much for that. Well understood and your methodology itself. Are you looking at OMB or 180 day or 90 day? OMB? We'd

Speaker 1  
be looking at in the instance of a business we don't typically attribute any value to any good will or anything like that. So again, the one that Aaron I were talking about yesterday was a going concern leisure business. So we'd be looking at MV three for something like that. Got

Speaker 2  
it well understood. Thank you very much for that. And as a kind of chaperone of people's capital, as you guys are, too, I guess in that you have your own fund. I always like to ask, knock on, would we never have this instance? But how do you treat the instance of extensions and worst case default? What's your policy for that? Please.

Speaker 1  
I mean, so communication and collaboration, particularly on the default point, is the most important thing. So so on extensions. So so long as in theory, the loans for value is okay, the borrower has conducted themselves acceptably whilst they've been with us, we don't have any real issue with extending the loans in any way there is typically an extension fee of up to one and a half percent. But, I mean, yeah, so long as long as there's no problems in that, that's fine a borrower and default. I mean, they get reminder notices from us six three and one months before their loans expire. So there should be no reason really, that alone should ever go beyond this period, although something we're really seeing at the moment is that loans have taken forever to be refinanced, but I think fairly is the way that I put it. So we will allow people additional time in default to rectify things, obviously, if they if there have been problems, or if they can't rectify either things themselves, then we will consider other enforcement actions, whether it's repossession property or appointing a receiver. But you'd have to be a long way down the line for it to get to that sort of conversation. Yeah, it would never come as a surprise to anybody. Put it that way. And

Speaker 2  
are you flipping to kind of if it wasn't serviced? Are you mandatory service upon extension, slash default? Are you changing the interest rates. I mean, again,

Speaker 1  
it depends very much on the loan to value. So if we were extending it, like we did an extension a couple of weeks ago, and they were something like 25% loan to value in that instance, so they don't need to service that at all if they're in default, we like them to service it, because obviously something's gone wrong by the fact that they're in default, and we don't want our exposures to them to increase any further. So I think it's each case on its merits. Really

Speaker 2  
got it. Yep, well understood. Thank you very much for that. And then if we were the opposite of an extension, almost if, if we take a 24 month term out of your sales and we repay in 12 months, are we only paying interest for those 12 months, or are there any non utilization fees. Harriet, do you grab this

Speaker 3  
one? Yes. So all we require is that there is 20 working days notice before repayment, and they'll pay interest up until the end of those 20 working days so they can repay it on the same day that they give us notice. If they want to, however, they would have to pay interest for those further 20 working days. That makes sense on it, yeah, days,

Speaker 2  
fine. And I assume, therefore your interest is calculated daily. Generally, you're not charging for the month that those 20 days are contained in. It's

Speaker 3  
yeah, calculated daily and then compounded monthly. What if there's if it's been rolled

Speaker 2  
well understood. Thank you very much for that. Okay, fine. We've

Speaker 1  
moved away from early redemption charges, by the way, just, just, just, just for background. We found that it was something that was very important to people having no early redemption charges, and nobody repays early anyway.

Speaker 2  
So, yeah, it's kind of psychological, a bit like on light refurb. I'm seeing an increasing number of lenders, such competition in the space that you're in, really and and a lot of lenders are as almost a headline piece increasing. I will do 75% net loan to value, 65% net loan to gdv. Well, loan to gdv is always the binding constraints. Yes, so, so it's a nice headline, and everyone you know probably attracts brokers again who aren't thinking about it properly. So well understood. Thank you for that. And then in terms of just your conveyancing process, first of all, do you offer dual representation at all? No, if

Speaker 1  
there was a very good reason in that they already use the solicitor that we do, then we would accept dual representation. But typically, no,

Speaker 2  
got it? Okay? Cool. Thank you very much for that. And in terms of the fastest completion times, and to facilitate those, do you kind of offer search, indemnity, insurance, title, indemnity, any of those features? Yeah,

Speaker 1  
we do. So this is the part that I was really hoping that we've come around. So our quickest completion from application to funds out the door and completing is one and a half days. Wow. Which is quick? I can give you some more examples of some really quick ones, if you like. So we had one a few weeks ago. It was auction, actually, when was it was when? When did that complete out it's just the one I'm thinking of. It was an auction purchase. They were supposed to complete their related sale fell through phone me on a Friday morning, saw them on the Friday afternoon, approved alone Monday morning, funds are out the door on Wednesday. So that's what it's about. That's what's that three working days turn around. But obviously that's relying on the second part of your question, on search, indemnity, title, indemnity, all that sort of stuff. So yeah, we're asking,

Speaker 2  
Okay, because I do have clients find out where clients that come to me that need funds quickly. And so what kind of profile you comfortable doing quick loans for

Unknown Speaker  
loans that we'll get our money back at the end of? Is the profile

Speaker 2  
here's hoping? Yeah, okay, yeah. It's a strong borrower and strong property profile, loan to value.

Speaker 1  
I don't know, not necessarily. I would say that they we would do any loan quickly on our normal terms, but it is. It's absolutely reliant on the borrower providing the information that we need quickly and giving us everything that we ask for quickly, and then instructing their solicitors quickly. So I'd say we would do any of our loans in a good speed because we've got quite robust, sort of internal processes and robust underwriting, in the sense that we are a smaller lender, but that allows us to be flexible and fast. So, so no, I wouldn't say that we would only do fast loans, sorry, fast loans for like, low range of values and stuff like

Speaker 2  
that. Okay, well understood. Thank you for that. Fine. And then in turn, you've mentioned before, and forgive me, because it just was a little bit quick, just on the unregulated bridging your 2% net arrangement fee, and I caught around one on 1.1% was it first charge rates on unreg, fine. Well understood in terms of commitment fees, application fees, procuration fees. Where do you sit with those fees?

Speaker 1  
I mean, so we don't typically charge any kind of commitment fee or anything like that. So at the point that the borrower signs our offer letter, they are bound to pay us the arrangement fee, whether the loan completes or not. The reason for that being that because we're privately funded, we are basically taking it from a pot, allocating it to them, for which there is a cost to us to make those funds available. But yeah, we don't typically charge a commitment fee. We've had we did one just at the beginning of January that was 3.3 million, and we took a 10,000 pound commitment fee on that one. We've got another one that's ongoing at the moment, which I need to apply to an email arm, which is 2.7 million, and we took 10,000 on that. But typically we don't take anything like that, or charge like an administration fee or anything like that. No fees, typically, again, for site visits, unless it's an auction purchase, which we charge 500 pounds, because it can be so much hard work for them not to lose the property, sorry, not to win the property. Procureation fees is probably the most important thing of all. We pay 1% on both development and bridging. So if you take development where our arrangement fee is 1% then we give that 1% to you. In its entirety, we would allow you to say, vary the arrangement fee if you wanted more, but it would have to be fully disclosed to the borrower. They would need to be happy with it themselves.

Speaker 2  
Or in light of that new case with about declaring commissions, yeah, of course, okay, oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  
I'm very, very aware of so, yeah,

Speaker 2  
yeah, well understood. Um, thank you for that. I think just maybe coming across appreciate and picking your brains, by the way. So thank you for being productive. I haven't caught you out yet. We haven't got a question. Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying with respect to your light refurbishment, and if that differs from your ground up constraints, what's your maximum loan to gdv? Please.

Speaker 1  
Maximum running gdv, so we don't so again, as part of our keeping things simple, we don't have a firm loan to gdv or loan to cost metric or anything like that. Typically, we like the Boris, but at least 40% of the overall project cost. But so long as we can satisfy ourselves that during the build they will be no greater than 70% loan to value, we would be happy with it. So in theory, let's say we've got a simple build project, or a conversion or build project, and they're willing to offer us 10 million pounds of security. Say we will lend them 100% and a little bit more, if they like. So it's bespoke, and that everyone is for every individual case. If that answers your question, got

Speaker 2  
it fine. Yeah, it's interesting that you're not constrained. There are a handful of lenders that aren't really constraining on gdv, and then the majority of the street is so it's interesting on with that respect. Um, okay, so if we provide you, provide you ample security, could be supplemental security as well. But do I understand quickly you'll give 100% potentially, of the purchase price and of the refurbishment works up to 70% gross loan to value of those securities. Uh,

Speaker 1  
yes, that'd be correct. I can give you an example, depending how you off time. But yes, we can do that.

Speaker 2  
Got it now? I think, I think I understand it. Well, um, so thank you for that. It with that, then are you? You also said you'd like, generally, developers, to put in 40% of the ongoing cost, if I heard you correctly. So do you have a minimum directors hurt equity or hurt cash, or can that be flattened to zero?

Speaker 1  
I mean, in theory, as as you said just a moment ago, as long as we're 70% of the growth security about value, then they don't need to put a penny in. In theory, the the 40% minimum loan to cost that I mentioned in terms of their contribution is more. It's not anything we've got written down everywhere. But in the time, I've been working it from experience, unless they're putting in 40% of the overall cost, it's not going to work on the loan to value. Loan to value matrix, typically, but

Speaker 2  
yeah, agree, yeah, yeah, unless you've got a supplemental security or something, you can top up, replace the cash with equity or something, absolutely, yeah. Ends up being about 40% so well understood. And would you allow planning uplift to contribute to inherent equity in the deal. So we agree a purchase price is now valued 500k more. Can that contribute? Or do you invest

Unknown Speaker  
your in house today? Or what do you think

Speaker 3  
I'd say, as long as that can be proven that the value has gone up, then, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  
cool. Okay. Personally, I'm

Speaker 1  
quite I'm a little bit wary on planning games. I think, like Harriet says, we will absolutely look at it, but we will need to absolutely verify why we are justifying the value of that game.

Speaker 2  
Yeah, and it needs to be legitimate, basically. So like that care home, I mean, the minute they got that planning through the gdv of both units was 5 million. So you've gone from purchasing one, what 1.45 and then suddenly you've got planning which, the cost of works was 300,000 pounds, and the GDP is 5 million. Phenomenal deal for those guys. So, so yeah, Barbara, number one, the comment very

Speaker 1  
nice place. Marba isn't that expensive, illustrious? Yeah, it's where Kate Middleton

Speaker 2  
went to college. I think George is being queued up. Yeah, I went to visit it two weeks ago. It's lovely, yeah, yeah, good. So, so well understood. And then, if not planning uplift, how about kind of equity partners behind or mezzanine lenders. Can they stack? Can we stack the capital structure? Or do you not like second charges behind you?

Speaker 1  
So we're fine with second charge lending behind us. We did have a project at the beginning of last year where they were very good developers, but they basically reached a point with us where we weren't willing to fund it anymore, because we weren't convinced that actually the gdbs that they they projected at the outset, were achievable. So we suggested to that they take mezzanine funding, which they did. So another lender came into the second charge behind us. However, any second charge lender behind us would have to sign a deed of priority, basically, in our prescriptive form, well

Speaker 2  
understood. And do you typically work with one mezzanine lender? Do you have relationships?

Speaker 1  
We don't have any relationship with any mesine lender. So yeah, whoever got

Speaker 2  
it got it fine. Well understood. Thank you for and again, on the development tranches, obviously, we'll provide a schedule of works, which we hope to stick to. But are you charging any non utilization fees if they don't end up drawing the remainder of those funds? No, you're not fine. So it's just the commitment when we sign the offer you have to pay a certain percentage to draw those funds, perhaps, but then the actual utilization is, is as and when required. So yeah, well, it

Speaker 1  
might be sort of you might class as a non utilization fee is, again, we talked about the privately funded thing. So we've got a loan completing on Friday for 1.1 million. It may draw late because there's so much going on the legals. But again, because we're privately funded, we're taking money that we will from Friday, be paying interest on ourselves. So basically, we fix a first drawdown date, and then they then pay, sorry if it's delayed by any reason, the interest starts to accumulate from that date, because it's costing us interest. So therefore it costs the borrower interest as well. So theory, if it draws a week late, they will have accumulated a week of interest or a development loan. We will agree a first drawdown amount, so whatever the first charge is required is and it's accumulated on that amount, but it's all very, very clearly spelled out within our loan

Speaker 2  
documentation. Got it fine. So we provide a schedule of works. If we draw quicker than the scheduler works, it will will be charged per our actual drawdown. If we draw slower, we'll be charged per our schedule of works. Yes, got it well understood. Okay, fine. Thank you very much. Fine. And do you have, I'm assuming, not because of the way you're funded, but do you have a preferred exit for development, sale or refinance,

Speaker 1  
as long as we get money and time it was legal, obviously,

Speaker 2  
not an insurance job, yeah, burn it down. Yeah, okay, got it well understood. And on your, forgive me. Harriet, you did say, but on your your interest rates for development. Where do you sit? Please.

Unknown Speaker  
They're around 1.25 1.25%

Speaker 2  
well understood. And your development exit products are you at the same kind of constraint, 70% gross, same maximum loan side, same 24 months term. Yes, you are brilliant. Thank you very much. And your interest rate on DevEx is the same as your unregulated bridging. Yeah,

Speaker 1  
I will say that there is, there is the, the possibility to flex the pricing for a better quality loan. It's not something we want to be giving away huge amounts of margin on. But, you know, we can reduce the pricing if needed. Very strong, well

Speaker 2  
understood. Thank you for that. Okay, cool. Thank you typing like my life depends on it, so I've got everything written in there. Okay, fine and regulated development self builds. I'm assuming we must service for that one through

Speaker 3  
no so any regulated loans are all rolled up.

Speaker 1  
Okay, so that. So that applies to development lending across the board, basically. So, so the way that I always look at it is, if the we're, if we're lending you 100,000 pounds in a tranche for development and you're giving us 6000 pounds back in interest, you're sort of paying us with our own money, really. So I we don't see the point in having interest service on development

Speaker 2  
loan. Yeah, nice. That's refreshing. That's, that's refreshing.

Speaker 1  
It's just keeping things simple and straightforward, really, because it's just doesn't make sense.

Speaker 2  
I don't think totally, totally, yeah, okay, cool. Well, out of interest, how did you guys start?

Speaker 1  
We started 10 years ago. It was three directors with a background in property who I think it's fair to say are each in their own right, white or very wealthy individuals that wanted to do something with their money. So that was what, that was, how it came about,

Speaker 2  
right? Okay, well understood. Interesting, okay, fine, um, okay. And I think perhaps I've gathered lots of information there. So thank you for your patience with me and running through that. I guess what I would ask is, if you were to say to me, Kelsey, you should be coming to us for this. This is really where we excel, or here's some creative applications. We've seen clients use our products with Yeah. How would you answer that question? Please. People

Speaker 1  
would come to us because they want people that are straightforward, easy to deal with and make sensible lending decisions. So I work for NatWest commercial banking for just over 10 years prior to joining. I did relationship management, business development. There seven years of new lending at the end, and it's it. We're easy to deal with and we're straightforward. It's sort of like dealing with a bank in the 80s. Is probably a sort of a way to put it in the sense that you we speak to the people that make the decisions. There's no hidden underwriting team in the background. And if it's something that makes sense for everyone, then that's what we do. So yeah, so easy to deal with, people that you can easily speak to, so people like myself and Harriet that you would deal with directly on the phone. And yeah, my screen's locked. But let me can I join a few? Just really I'll give you some real headlines and good stuff. So 2.2 million pound bridging loan on a property worth 3.9 million. I went and saw them Monday last week that's completing on Friday, 200,000 pound development loan that Harriet has done for a holiday, let somebody's building in the back of their garden. Exciting one 3.3 million pound bridging loan against agricultural was it agricultural land with planning for something like 60 properties that's being sold to a national home builder, they had to exchange quicker than basically, they had to exchange on their purchase. They're going to flip it make like 700,000 pounds profit, but they had to exchange on their purchase before the purchase for the sale were ready. So that's that one 750,000 pound bridging loan against one and a half million pounds of property for a leisure business in Devon just needed some additional cash flow during the winter months and to pay some large legal bills. Do you always keep talking,

Speaker 2  
or it's interesting to hear? Yeah, and thank you for there any particular deals that you've seen in your time at bricks that you're like that's actually very clever strategy, or that's a very clever implementation, or is it kind of, there's nothing that springs to mind

Speaker 1  
in terms of, I talked about, like sensible lending and doing things that make sense. So when I was at NatWest, we were it was always hammered into us that loads of values calculated the lesser of valuation or purchase price. We had somebody come to us that wanted to purchase commercial premises that they rented for 10 years. They've done considerable amounts of work to the property in that period, and the vendor, or their current landlord, hadn't written within their sorry. I should have said within their tenancy agreement, there was an option to purchase something like 10 years, but there was no ratchet in like there's no inflation clauses or anything like that, like you might expect if you're sensible. So basically, they've done a hell of a lot of work to the property, which has increased the value since they've taken it on. But their option to purchase was actually considerably lower than the current value. So we were able to earn 100% of the purchase price for them to for them to obtain their property. I'd say, I'd say that a bit clever. I don't know if you'd agree.

Speaker 2  
Yeah, that is clever. Yeah. Okay, brilliant. Well, I have certainly deals that require common sense. I can think of a few right now that don't quite fit into your loan to value constraints, but they do come up all the time. So I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me very much so, and it's been a pleasure to meet you guys and what what will happen now, I've been writing notes, and you very kindly populated the form before we sat down, so if you could see, it's like a absolutely massive matrix of criteria. And as I have conversations with clients, you will become naturally filtered into those conversations. And I said, tend to send kind of a pitch deck that will become refined to your requirements over time. So yeah, thank you very much for that.

Speaker 1  
Good bloody well. Thanks. Stay in touch, and anything that you do get, if you send across to Harriet and I, we'd love to have a look,

Speaker 2  
amazing, absolutely, I will be back in touch. Guys. Thank you very much. Thanks

Unknown Speaker  
a lot. Take care. Bye. Bye. You.
