Speaker 1  
Went out with a family and that, yeah, it was good. So we stayed together, like, a few nights there, and then we flew back together on the Sunday and we did a New Year's Eve in London. So it was quite nice. What do you do? Yeah, we went to a city social in Tower 42 it was quite expensive, to be fair. It was like five courses each, but live music and that, yeah, it's good. Laugh. It was good. It was really good.

Arose Finance  
And tower 42 Yeah, don't think I know that tower 42 right?

Speaker 1  
Yeah, city social. It was like a Michelin star sort of restaurant. Yeah, it was a bit mad to be fair. Okay, eating the food, you know, stuff like ox cheek sauce. And you're like, What is this tasting on where we are? What?

Arose Finance  
Yeah, could you see where you were? Yeah?

Speaker 1  
See the fireworks as well. See the fireworks. DJ come out and that, yeah, it was good, to be fair, it was

Arose Finance  
good. Laughs, good. Yeah. No, no. Go on. Yeah, no. I

Speaker 1  
was just going to say we were sitting down in that and then Connor Ben, the famous box, sort of come down and sit behind us as well. I was like, yeah, definitely in the wrong place here. Like, 1000 pound Louis Vuitton shirt on, brilliant mate.

Arose Finance  
You're showing her London. You're showing her London, yeah, one side of London. Yeah, yeah. Mine was way we went to so I had a couple of options. I've got a friend who has a house in in Deptford, and was having loads of people over, basically, like, kind of gathering type thing. So I was either going to go there. My best friend lives in the south of France, she flew over. So we were like, regardless, we'll spend it together. And I thought she lives her family homes out in wilt and most amazing farm. And I thought it might be more wholesome out in the farm, but she's like, No, I want to go London. Want to go London. So we ended up going to a friend of a friend was DJ in a Japanese restaurant, and it was kind of like funk. So didn't see the any fireworks at all. But it's nice to be around all my old like uni lot as well. Were there where I haven't seen for years, and I was with my best mate, so yeah, it was nice.

Unknown Speaker  
Sounds good. What

Arose Finance  
was that? Sorry? Messy. Yeah, a bit yeah, definitely a bit messy. Yeah. I think different people peaked at different times. Like, some people went very, very early, then they like, kind of came back into their own. And then other people, I was kind of like, I was just consistent through the night, but, um, but yeah, so messy, I would say, Oh, I've

Speaker 1  
got you done in it. How you found January as well? Busy in it, January is

Arose Finance  
very busy. Yeah, it's busy. It's good though. It's like, I feel like a lot of the groundwork that I was putting in towards the tail end the last year kind of starting to pay off. So I've brought someone into the business, like an admin assistant, yeah, which is a big investment of time. But we're going early, so we both start at seven and seven in the morning, and then we'll do like training for like half seven to like half eight, probably every single day. We're getting an hour in the day between clients. I can't even get that for to submit an application. Never mind do a training session, you know, yes. So it's good. We're doing early morning training, and then she's getting it like she's, which is good. It's good. Like, you know, sometimes I've worked with people when I used to be employed before, and you can explain things and they're not getting in. It's like, a real

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, so it goes in one ear comes out the other, innit.

Arose Finance  
It's just retention of it. Like, you've got to tell people 10 times I'm I'm like that. You got telling me 10 times before my brain absorbs it, but she's not like that. What Mary, her name is. So that's very, very exciting, very busy. Yeah, absolutely. Things been busy your side.

Speaker 1  
Yeah, they've been mental to be fair, and getting came by lots of buyers to let at the minute still, to be fair, so we're still trying to push the bridge in a little bit more. But yeah, buy to let's just got mental we've still got the same rate as 6.04% but we're just getting it must be getting, like 810, deals a week on it, like not even shouting for it, not going for it. It's not pushing for

Arose Finance  
it. It's coming in. What's your USP on buy to let what buy to

Speaker 1  
let. It's more like criteria with us, so that's really what we've always known for. Specialist buy to let. First time buyers, first time landlords, foreign nationals, expats, complex company structures, including trusts, holding companies, stuff like that.

Arose Finance  
On HMOs. Do you at what level do you request a commercial valuation rather than a brick and mortar valuation?

Speaker 1  
Seven bed above, seven bed above. We go investment bar. Got

Arose Finance  
you? Okay, fine. Yeah, I'm looking for, I've got six beds and above, but I'm looking for five beds. So I'm looking for a lender that will do five beds in a commercial bar. You know the ones where they're all on suites, and it's like, clearly, yeah,

Speaker 1  
it's a bit tricky, to be fair, in it. I think we, we've had a I've had a few exceptions when it's six beds, but yeah, would be five. Five's a bit tough.

Arose Finance  
Five, yeah, I'm searching for it. Someone will do it somewhere, someone Yeah,

Speaker 1  
someone will Yeah, maybe together. That's

Arose Finance  
it, yeah. But no, it was nice to meet before Christmas. And yeah, no, I wanted to kind of sit down a little bit more granularly on your lending policy, if that's okay, and make the most of our our time. I've got a half 10 meetings. I want to make sure that I've kind of got all the bits that are going to help me when I'm having conversation with clients. Then you guys are going to filter straight into those conversations so, and also, it'd be polite for me to say, I just realized I've got a note taker in the room with us. Yeah. Is that okay with you? Yeah, of course. Yes. Fine, yeah. Just make, make some notes and summarizes our conversation. So to kind of drill into and I'm going to kind of, like, start high level, and then maybe, like, narrow in on some some details, if that's all right. But in terms of how you started and your funding line, what's the kind of backdrop to yourselves? Who funds you? Who's your shareholders? How does that work? Please, yeah.

Speaker 1  
So we're Yeah. So we're funded by JC flowers. They're an American billionaire investment company. I think they fund OSB group as well, quite a lot of other asset companies. So we're pretty much just a drop in the pond for them guys. But yeah, I think, yeah, we're, we're pretty profitable. We're doing really well at the minute, and I think they're starting to see the growth as well. We're getting a lot of new people starting, and they're just giving us more and more capital. But yeah, our target is definitely more based on the bridging now, and that has changed in recent years, probably since I sort of joined in March 23 really, I think it was more buy to let than bridging, and then sort of since I come in, it was kind of the main focus became bridging. And that's when we came out with our USPS for bridging, still doing buy, to let. We still get a lot of it, as I said, but yeah, bridging is our sort of main focus, main USPS now. And I think we're finally in a place now as well, where we're actually seen as a bridging lender, and people actually think Castle, trust, you know, reefer, bridge, HMO conversion, even a heavy refurb with planning permission, commercial to resi conversions. And you know, no one else does our net day one, and we've got the best rates since we dropped them on six of Jan. We're now cheaper than shore Brook, lend, invest, Len CO, Glen, Hawk, octane, absolutely everyone that's on

Arose Finance  
you must buy in. I'm not asking anything. I don't you know that. You can't say, but you must buy in cash, quite cheaply, to be on the rates that you're on now, yeah, yeah, cost of funds, something like that. Yeah, I would

Speaker 1  
have also, in fairness, it is surprising how, yeah, how we can sort of drop the rate and and keep profitable. To be fair, do think sometimes, like 80% net at point seven, nine is just ridiculous. It's a bit like octopus in it, where they've got their own funds and they do that point five, five, vanilla product in it, a bit. But

Arose Finance  
yeah, yeah. And I was going to say so if you're JC flowers in COVID, your funding line, your if you really liked a borrowing profile. Do you ever, I guess the question is, do you have any discretion around that those money, you know, can you lean into loan to values, or is it quite constrained capital? Obviously, it's flexible, but it's like, that is what it is. It's

Speaker 1  
quite constrained, really. So yeah, I feel like we get, we kind of get a pot of funds, and it's for that set, for that product. So at the minute as well, we're doing quite a lot of exclusives as well for brokers that have given us quite a bit of business just to make them feel special, as well, as I say, if you're doing probably eight to 10 deals a month, something like that. So we've got a buy and sell it exclusive at the minute, and we haven't got a bridging one anymore. So when we drop the rates on the sixth of January for our bridging product, that used to be the exclusive rates, and we just made them standard pricing. So that was pretty good. And what we do on the exclusives, we usually set a set completion date. So for instance, we've just brought out a new 5.69 buy to lay exclusive on a five year fixed, all the same criteria, 3% fee, and they've got a complete by the 31st of March. And there's no exceptions on that as well. So if it don't complete, then it reverts back to standard pricing,

Arose Finance  
right? Gotcha. And what's the idea behind the timeline? There

Speaker 1  
is, I think, just to push, yeah, I'd say just to push completions, really, because, you know, some can, you know, some deals. There's so many different scenarios, you know, probate stuff like that, where cases can just drag on quite a bit as well. But I think it probably comes down to them, cost of funds as well, where it is, you know, 5.69 for a specialist rate, with all the criteria we can do, first time buyers, first time landlords, foreign nationals, expats, holiday lets times 40 weeks instead of AST income as well, multi unit, three old blocks off aggregate value, up to 20 units instead of block 5.6 nines. Very

Arose Finance  
does the title need to be split on the aggregate value?

Unknown Speaker  
It would, yeah, okay, got

Arose Finance  
it because I got one of my clients is the block buying group. I don't know if I mentioned them to you, but they basically specialize in that, but they're trying to obviously split titles. They know you get the aggregate value, but that's a cost associated, especially if it's 20 units

Unknown Speaker  
or something like that. True, good point.

Arose Finance  
So bridges will do some bridges will do aggregate value without the titles being split. So but, and then, but what we're looking for is a term lender that will do block aggregate to get us off of the bridging. So it should buy in BMV, uplifting the yield, and then bridging to buy it, because you can get you know, as you know yourselves, 90% net they, you know, RV could, some lenders will even do 100% of the purchase price on that basis, if it's discounted enough. But then we need the term exit basically,

Speaker 1  
of course, yeah, and they don't want to split them because of the cost, just the cost.

Arose Finance  
Yeah, yeah, true. They can split them, but they prefer not to if they don't have to. And so that's the holy grail of, yeah, of lender.

Unknown Speaker  
I guess any lenders do that, do they all?

Arose Finance  
I've got the bridging piece. I've got lenders will do it. But if you bridge to buy so you can buy these with no cash in because, yeah, you know, because

Speaker 1  
think either more ultimate finance 200% didn't

Arose Finance  
they? Yeah, exactly, yeah. That's exactly it and you but then once you purchased it, most lenders as well, in the first six months away going off the purchase price, rather than the OMB correct,

Speaker 1  
that's correct. So we don't do that. So we're quite quirky with that. We don't care if it was purchased a month ago, two weeks ago, if you're complete on the bridge, the next day, we'll work off market value, not purchase price.

Arose Finance  
So pretty impressive. It has to be split, yeah, but it would have to be split, gotcha, gotcha. Okay, fair enough. And then roughly how big is your line book, Ryan, do you know?

Unknown Speaker  
Say yeah, I'll double check, but I'm pretty sure it's just under a billion. Think eight, 900 million. Yeah,

Arose Finance  
and are you looking to grow this year?

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah? I think so, yeah. I think about 20% growth, right? Okay,

Arose Finance  
cool. And you're becoming regulated as well, aren't you?

Speaker 1  
We are, yeah, so that is, I think they're going through the policies and everything at the minute, that'll probably be, they said, April, but I reckon May, June. I reckon we'll actually, it might even be after that, to be fair, but, yeah, that'd be really cool. Random quarries I turn away as well. Should be nice. Turn another,

Arose Finance  
yeah, another bosni, yeah, yeah. Why not 100% do you see a lot of rig? I try to avoid it like a plague, yeah? But I am regulated, but it's just, it's a lot more paperwork for the same content of deals. So I see some reg and I do it. I am regulated myself and like, we're very compliant. But,

Speaker 1  
yeah, stick here when it's their own house as well, when it's not a buy to let,

Arose Finance  
yes, it's their own house. Or I try to stick, I don't try and see clear as the language I should not be using. But, like, I'm not actively seeking, you know, certain types of client profiles. So a lot of my clients are professional investors, portfolio developers, yes, direction of the business. That's where I think we add most value. So, so, so, yeah. And in terms of kind of like, associations, charters, your nacfb, are you bdla, FIBA? Do you have any of those? Don't

Speaker 1  
believe, I think mainly na CFB, na CFA.

Arose Finance  
Cool. Thank you very much for that. Cool. And then in terms of the form you very kindly populated. Kind of gives me a good overview. So you're lending in England and Wales, you're lending most borrower profiles, apart from sip and SaaS. So no pension schemes, not charities, not community interest companies, which are like charities in some ways. You're currently not doing regulated bridging, but you could be as of the middle of this year, should

Speaker 1  
be strictly ready as well. But hopefully we might go semi commercial, but I think that'll be next year. Now, after we go, after we go regulated. First gotcha, we

Arose Finance  
would you let me know when you are live on, on regulated and then also semi commercial, please.

Speaker 1  
Yeah, of course. Yeah, great, thanks. We still ain't got that system I was talking to you about last month to be there again. We was expecting it this month, and it's been pushed back again, like, oh God, but I think it's going to be like, one more month they're saying. But just never know. I think there's just a few TV problems with it. But be unreal When it's out, because lending, CHL, use it. It's a really good system. What's it called? Um, we've got our own name for it, um, a prevo and pulse, so I'm not sure what, but yeah, lend, CO, use it. Len, invest and CHL. So if you've submitted to any of them, but the exact same system, I think, uh huh. But I think we've tailored it to our own needs as well, so you can actually do your own terms. We should be coming out with AVMS as well for probably standard bridging and just buy to let I think, but, yeah, won't work on the refurbs, will it? But that'd be pretty cool.

Arose Finance  
You're not doing that. You're not doing you're in on the bridging front. You're doing resi only. You're not doing commercial bridging. Are you

Speaker 1  
correct? Unless the commercials got planned in to convert back to resi. Got it? That's literally it.

Arose Finance  
Got it, fine. Okay, cool. So maybe right? And here's one question, do you lend for? Say, if you've got an asset that is owned in a limited company. Let's say it's a multi unit freehold block that was owned in a limited company. Client wants to purchase the asset, but really they're purchasing the company which owns the asset. Yeah, would you lend for purchasing that business that contains the asset? You would, yeah, we would. You would, okay, cool, fine, and then maybe drilling into a little bit more kind of the terms for your unregulated resi bridge. So you'll do stand alone first charge. You won't do stand alone seconds or equitables,

Speaker 1  
correct? Yeah, so it's strictly first charge. But I think the only time I've kind of had exceptions on seconds, if we're taking a first on the main security, and then say we're taking a second charge, potentially on another buy to let, where we're just raising some of the funds for either deposit or the works, really, gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah, it's got to be a strong client, a low OTV, really. I've only had, I think, three four exceptions on it the last couple of years. I do

Arose Finance  
quite a lot of that cross collateralization, where it's like a first charge on the subject site, and then we'll do an equitable charge on an existing buy to let Would you ever do that on an equitable charge basis? Or, yeah, probably not.

Speaker 1  
So yeah, we can be quite flexible, though, with criteria in that. So we have two meetings every day, one's half 11 and one's at four o'clock, and that's where we basically just jump on the call with the head of credit risk and a couple of senior underwriters as well. So say, if it's an exception on the security type, if it's maybe not in a holiday, let location or their adverse criteria, they've got one missed payment in, say, the last year for mortgages, because usual rule for us is none in last 12 and three or four blips in the last three years. So,

Arose Finance  
right. Okay, nice. Thank you very much. Pretty flexible. Pretty flexible. And your minimum and maximum loan sizes, I've got your 200k to five mil. Yeah,

Speaker 1  
it's pretty bang on, really, we can go up to 10, pretty rarely. But yeah, I'd say 10s of complete max. And that's like, subject to board, subject to board.

Arose Finance  
Got it? Yeah, do you constrain around the, like, minimum property value at all? You're just looking at loan sizes. Really, just

Speaker 1  
loan sizes, to be honest, yes, if it fits, if it's but, yeah, it's 200k net, day one, sort of across the boards foreign nationals and expats is 300k for a bridge and 500k for a turn deal. So they're quite high. You know, quite a lot of other lenders, they'll either have a more expensive rate or higher arrangement fee for foreign nationals and expats are our minimum loans are just quite high, to be fair. Yeah,

Arose Finance  
gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, and I've got just on your line to value. I've got here. You're typically 80% net, but that's where the purchase price equals the OMB, and where the purchase price doesn't equal the OMB, it's 90% correct.

Speaker 1  
Yeah, so you know better than me making sure I got, we do forget about that. Is that BMV criteria just randomly come out last year. I had a case that we were sort of going to lose, and the client was getting such a good deal on it was like a 12 bed multi unit, three old blocks just finished sort of in Brighton, and we tried getting on the light refurb products. Yeah. It was just unreal. We come out with that, yeah. So it is even 90% net of purchase price or 80% net of current value, whichever is lower the two. And then we've still got to be within 75% loan to gdv as well. But yeah, all of the same rates on their net or TVs as well. So sometimes we're like 102% gross LTV. It's just mental, really.

Arose Finance  
Yeah, it's unreal. Your loan to gdv, that's 75% net loan to GV. Is it

Unknown Speaker  
gross? It is Gross. Gross. Yeah,

Arose Finance  
got it fine. And where we are, if we were to do that, where we take a first charge on one site, a second charge on it on a different site. Do you constrain around the some lenders will say, yeah, we'll take a second charge on that along with the first charge, but on the first charge of that asset, we that has to be capped at 55% loan to value. Do you constrain on the first charge?

Unknown Speaker  
No, yeah, we've done

Arose Finance  
cool, fine, you've not got AVMS desktop short forms at the moment, but they might be coming. Yeah,

Speaker 1  
they might be coming. So, yeah, all physical Val with vast panel still at the minute, fine.

Arose Finance  
OMB, three month to 18 month term. I

Speaker 1  
think it should be six. I think is it? Yeah? Six months. Yeah, six months. Standard bridge. We have increased our term on the light refurb as well, so we can go 15 months on that now, but yeah, Max 18 months for the heavier refurbs and planning involved or structural works.

Arose Finance  
Got it, got it fine. And how would it work if a client wanted to extend? Have you guys always asked this is, can you extend? What's the cost for that? Yes,

Speaker 1  
we're pretty flexible again when it comes to this. And a couple of calls in the last few weeks with service in where clients, you know, they've got the property on the market, it's just struggling to sell for maybe the price they want. Yeah, we're pretty flexible. So we'd either offer a one to three month extension on the existing bridge at a set cost. It's kind of case by case, I'd say anything from sort of maybe 1000 to three and a half grand, something like that, for a set cost on the the extension fee. But yeah, if, if servicing are aware it's probably going to take a bit longer, the SAL hasn't actually gone through. They haven't got an offer agreed, and their terms going to expire in two months, then we would just look to re bridge back to us. It basically just be a New Deal, new arrangement, fee, a new property, etc.

Arose Finance  
That's good, actually, yeah, it's quite good. To be

Speaker 1  
fair, we don't just, I've never known a scenario where we've just, you know, gone no, you're on default next day after your expiry. In fairness, got

Arose Finance  
it fine. And if, if they did default, do you know what your default rate of interest is?

Unknown Speaker  
Yes, 3% 3%

Arose Finance  
okay, got it Fingers crossed. Never have that, that circumstance now so retained, rolled up, serviced. I know that you do all of those. Do you also offer kind of Part and Part? If they wanted to combine? We

Speaker 1  
don't actually do serviced anymore. We did have a service product, but we pulled it so, yeah, rolled up interest mainly. But yeah, we don't really do Part and Part. Ava really got it fine.

Arose Finance  
Okay? And your interest and picking your brains. Here is that calculated daily or monthly. It's calculated

Unknown Speaker  
daily and compounded monthly,

Arose Finance  
compounded monthly. Thank you. Are you guys offering dual representation you do? Don't you? Yeah,

Speaker 1  
yeah. We are at the minute. So it's Paris Smith, light fit light foots can only do it for refinances, but Paris Smith can do it for purchases and remotes, and the same for Russell cook as well. Russell can do it for purchases and removes.

Arose Finance  
Got it fine. I know how quickly we did our legals when we got the valuation turn around, so I'm imagining you kind of search indemnity insurance, you'll have title indemnities, correct? Yeah.

Speaker 1  
Title Insurance up to two mil. I think it is.

Arose Finance  
Two mil. Got it fine. And what's the fastest deal you've ever seen go through with yourself? What would you say is the average,

Speaker 1  
my fastest one? I think I had eight days. I think it's a standard bridge amazing. That's

Arose Finance  
pretty happy with that. Yeah, very good. And average you'd say, is what, four to six weeks? Yeah,

Speaker 1  
to be honest, four to six weeks. But yeah, if it's an auction purchase, we always hit the 28 day. We will just escalate it with underwriting, make sure we've got Val quotes back, get it instructed early next week, and then get the ball rolling with solicitors as well. But yeah, I'd say four to six, probably fair. And then term, probably eight to 10 weeks,

Arose Finance  
same with term, yeah, gotcha. Okay, cool. Thank you for that. And your So, your BMV product, your, just to be clear, you offering that on simple bullet bridges is that only light reverb that you'll

Speaker 1  
do. It's only for light and heavy refurbs. Yeah. So it's a bit weird, really, because everyone else does it on standard bridges, don't they? But we, we, I think they just ended up agreeing it with credit that they want to see them adding a bit more value to it. So we're kind of covered in the deal they're getting in the equity of a good deal, and then obviously doing it up as well, and then still to be within 75% loan to gdv. So in theory, we could actually do 90% net day one at the purchase price, or 80% net current value, and 100% of the works, if it's still within so when we fund the works is 70% loan to gdv, and when we done fund the works is 75%

Arose Finance  
gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, makes makes sense.

Speaker 1  
Is 250 net day one for the draw down one. And I think it's, yeah, we always thought it was 100 cow works. It's actually 50 car works. And that's draw down 50k works.

Arose Finance  
Got it? Okay. So even, is that even true for light refurb, or is it just a heavier refurb that you've got 250 k? So

Speaker 1  
it's a bit confusing, really. So we've got, we've got the light refurb product that is just 80% net day one. All works under PD, HMO conversion, up to six tenants, etc, 80% net at purchase price within 75% loan to gdv and the rate on that 2.79 now we've also got a heavy refurb product, which is pretty much the same as the light. If planning permissions in place, day one, we'll give you 80% net. No works funded. If planning permissions not in place, day one, we'll just give you 75% net. That will be an 18 month term as well. And then the point of that bridge is for you to go for planning, get planning within six months, do the works. And then we've still got three to four months to either sell it or refi to exit us. So that's them, two products, and then the drawdown product. We call it the heavy drawdown product, but it's really just a draw down product. So it could be if works are under PD or planning permissions in place day one, they could both fit on that product. So we do quite a lot of six bed HMO conversions on it, because that's under PD. So if they're buying a 333 40, and just flipping a mid terrace house to a six bed, reconverting the rooms, etc, and then say it's probably 6070, gram of works. We'll just fund that in arrears, one draw down. So we do that quite a bit as well. And then we see the heavier projects, commercial to resi conversions, and we can fund works up to a million pounds.

Arose Finance  
Uh huh. Okay, so we can do the bigger ones. Got it? Okay, cool. And on the non drawn funds when they're not yet drawn. Are you charging non utilization fees on any of those? We're not no. Okay. Cool. So that implies to me, because I always ask question number one, because obviously clients need to know up front if they are or not, but, but also it ultimately derives down from your funding line, if you're being charged non utilization fees, like, if you're if you've got to draw everything I find with some lenders that gives, like, ulterior incentive structures. Yeah, they basically, they're either got, like, I think we've spoken about lenders that have got a load of funding on their back, their balance sheet, and they've got to get it off as quick as possible. But yes, trust in them. They're being charged money. So and, yeah, basically, if you can draw down and lend out on a draw down basis, then it's, I think it's a better, better structure. So, okay, cool. Thank you for that. And in terms of your dev exit products, yeah, are you the same thing against 80% net? No.

Speaker 1  
So on our dev exit, we're 75 gross. So it just goes on to our standard bridge product, which is really competitive right now, actually. So we're point seven five for 75% gross, point seven 270 gross, and that's including interests, net loan and arrangement fee. So on 75 grows on a 12 months, we're using it out to 66% and yeah, DevEx, it's got to be wind and water, tire, majority of the works done. And really PC building regs to be sort of within a month, six weeks.

Arose Finance  
Yeah, gotcha. And your min, min and max, say, 200 to 10 mil, potentially,

Speaker 1  
pretty much, yeah, pretty much. Got it. And

Arose Finance  
your maximum term on dev exit is that 18 months.

Speaker 1  
That would be 12 months for dev exit, yeah, exits on a standard bridge.

Arose Finance  
Got it fine. That was a popular product last year with with clients just getting caught. There's no momentum in the market.

Speaker 1  
Yeah, it's true, I think, yeah, I'll be honest. We don't, we don't really like them as much, because it's just, it's just such a bigger risk. You know, taking someone else's project on, especially when building regs, ain't signed off. We really, we usually want monitoring, surveyor report as well, just to make sure works have been monitored. But, yeah, I did get a big one in Monday. I think was that. I think that was like 12 units in Ken, yeah, really nice flats, but they only had about 20 grand worth of works. PC is going to be off in a couple of weeks, really, finishing off landscaping, etc. Yeah, I won that offshore Brook because our rates now point seven five, it's, it's cheaper than everyone,

Arose Finance  
really, you won ours, the care home off of shorebrook as well. Yeah, true off of shoreb. It's just a service. Unfortunately, I don't want to sadly, Jamie, it's just your services is a real selling point. So, yeah, I actually went down to the site on Friday. Last Friday, yeah, went went down, saw the guys, and, I mean, they're such Stand Up Guys. Like, really, yeah, really nice. Showed me all round marble. Showed me it's so close. And there's like, basically, I don't know if you've ever been to more broad. I had never been. But there's like, there's, like, a beautiful Market Center to it. So there's a road that runs, but it's the widest road I think in England. I think it's really like, yeah, single road, but it's like, really wide, all cobbled streets in the middle market town. And you can't be, literally, if it can't be any more than a five minute walk up to the care home, which is number one, the common and they've done really well. They've full steam ahead, Said workers all in there. They've demolished all out the back, grabbed, re landscaped, some of the stuff, and they're using it at the front, some of the gravel. So being quite smart with the way that they're doing it, but going into it realize that it actually doesn't need that much work. It's a house really, yeah, it doesn't need, like, if I said, if I I will send you after this call, actually, I'll send you some photos. And it's like, you could just carpet it, and you could just paint it, and you could live in it. It's, it's a grand, Victorian, beautiful, high ceilings, higher ceilings, yeah, yeah. It's massive, so it won't take much for them. And what they had a lot of in there was, like, the the interior designers kind of going through and saying, like, quite clever configuration, because, because it has been a care home, it's like, there's so many rooms and bathrooms in each room. So they're like, we're just going to knock this all out, pull this through. So, and they've got, like, wine cellars that they're thinking of putting in and so, yeah, yeah. It'd be nice to see when it's when it's done. It'd be nice to see, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  
definitely. How much was the work? 180 grand or something? Will it 180

Arose Finance  
grand? Because, because the configuration is it that's all going to go to, like, just making it nice, basically, because there's no brick work, there's no plumbing work, there's no electric work, yeah, it was already split in two. All of the electric, all of the Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  
yeah, new since the first call,

Arose Finance  
yeah, yeah. So that was amazing. Thank you for that. So I think that's pretty good. I've got most your product base is not, you know, normally I go on to development finance or your loan, but I've got the guts of what you do is unregulate, resi, buy to let term, refer, bridges, re, bridges, Dev, exits, yeah, so I've got the crux of and all the products that you'll do, I guess I would ask, like, one question I'd like to ask is, for the years that you've been at Castle Trust Bank, or even before, when you were working at a different lender, was like, at the Most interesting deal that you've seen where you thought that's a clever way to use our products, or

Speaker 1  
interesting deal you see so many don't? Yeah, I'll probably have a think on that. None stick to mine. Yeah, to be fair, probably getting about 2530 inquiries a day at the minute. But I think, like I think with the, I think with the refurb ones, this is usually just an auction purchase, a bit of a rundown house, something that needs internal reconfiguration, six bed HMO conversions, mid terrace houses. There has been a few sort of commercial ones. Yeah, it's been a few commercial ones that have been quite clever, like old warehouses, flipping it into, they've got the planning permission, flipped it into 10 flats or or a large HMO stuff like that. There was one actually, that we did. What was that that was like, it was in, I think it was Northampton, and it was an old dance studio, and they got planning permission to convert it into 14 flats, and the purchase price was like 800k Yeah, and the works was like a million pounds, but that's just going through now. That should, should complete quite soon, to be fair, but yeah, really experienced developers, yeah, it looked mad from the outside to be fixed. It still look quite commercial, but, but, yeah, it'd be interesting to see once that's sort of done and and up and running, really.

Arose Finance  
But, yeah, yeah, nice, yeah, it's interesting. I mean, we all obviously love property deals and, like, yeah, I always ask because, because, you know, there's some creative deals that I've seen, like golden tree as a development finance lender they, you know, told me about a deal where, basically the developer had pre sold the unit, so before they put a shovel in the ground, so already pre sold on to Housing Association. And so enabled the lender to reduce their reliance on the valuation. Course, has still got one down, because it's pre sold the exits guaranteed. So it enabled them to be more flexible around the figures and kind of talk to the value and say, look, here's what's been sold. Is it worth what it's been sold for? Yeah, yes. And so I thought that was quite a clever way to de risk the deal. Yeah. So, so yeah, there's that. And then I think the only other thing I'd ask you, is what you'd say you're absolutely best at, which sounds like it's probably going to be the light refurb, um, majority

Speaker 1  
of our business, I'll be honest. I thought the, I thought the drawdown one would start taking over a little bit like 75 in there. 100% of works. But the thing is, with that product, we still need to it's kind of like refi exit only. So if it is so exit, we technically can't fund the works, and that's just all to do with our risk waiting on book because we're 150% risk on a sow exit and 35% risk on a refi exit,

Arose Finance  
really?

Speaker 1  
Oh yeah. So sow exit, the the rates are all higher. Arrangement fees are slightly higher. Obviously, we have a few little tips and tricks where, you know, if it fits on the on the refi rental stress test, which is 125, ICR, 5.5% pay rate. People put it in a refire, and if it completes and they sell it, you know, yeah,

Arose Finance  
yeah. I like it.

Speaker 1  
Always tips and tricks to get around it, but, but, yeah, even a few, I've had a few quirks where doing one deal recently, it was like a big detached old farmhouse near sort of Cheltenham way, and I think we was funding the works on it as well. There was an extension approved, and it's a couple underground works, etc. Obviously, the rental came back, valuation was well lower. We couldn't fund the works. We couldn't get in 70% net, let alone 75 with the works, and including all the interest and our full bridge and balance being within 70% loan to gdv. So I kind of had the idea, and obviously, where we use holiday let income. So we got a letter from one of the agents, and we just took the low, medium and higher income and tied by 40 weeks. And as soon as you got that, it fit again. And we went off, went off that rental income. So quite good. Yeah,

Arose Finance  
that's good. Your income is, is good. I would

Speaker 1  
say that's the best thing times 40 weeks. Yeah, yeah. HDb, 35 I think they're still a bit more expensive than us.

Arose Finance  
You get a few that are 37 but, yeah, I've done all this research. Yeah, you get a few that are face seven, but the full got me up there. Yeah, to

Speaker 1  
be fair, ICR is quite high on it still. To sort of cap the risk, 165, Ico, yeah, yeah,

Arose Finance  
on your draw down products. That's when it's classifying. It must be to do its classification is like a as a commercial asset or development, I guess development finance, isn't it so. But your light, your light refurb, where you're not funding, the works can go you're not trying, 50% on the sale, exit,

Speaker 1  
which? On the sale, exit. So it's it's point seven, nine rate on the light refurbished refi. Exit fits on the 1255, and a half stress test, or it's point 9% if it's so exit and the arrangement fees are higher. So we used to be 2.25 arrangement fee on all products. Now we've just kept 2.25 on sow exit, and we actually dropped all refi exit to 2% keeping Property 2% still on bridging and 1.5 on term as well. So, but yeah, sorry,

Arose Finance  
Ryan. Sorry, your margin requirements. They're only your 150% for sale exits, the margin you have to keep is only on your drawdown products, not on your bullet bridges, it's on all of them, is it?

Speaker 1  
Yes, anything that sell? Exit? Yeah, really.

Arose Finance  
Okay, got it, yeah,

Speaker 1  
I think we did get stung on a few I'll be honest, in the past, I think where it was so exit. Think refi, when it's going through with another lender, is just, yeah, just seems to be a much, sort of quicker process for sometimes, but in the last couple of years, just a preferred exit. I think you're seeing a few other lenders sort of taking similar routes as well. There's like, an exit fee on if it's for instance, we've got that now as well. If it's a standard bridge, so exit, or a dev exit, the sow exit, it'd be point eight, five, right? And a 1% exit fee. We've got no exit fee for standard bridge, if it's a refi exit, or if it's on that internal stress, really. But it's quite clever, because it's just a backup exit, really. In it, we're stuck really. So, yeah,

Arose Finance  
so it makes sense to try and make it work on a refi basis. Yeah, yeah. Okay, cool, amazing. Thank you so much for that. That's very helpful,

Speaker 1  
right? Well, good, hopefully get a few more in. Be good, yeah,

Arose Finance  
yeah, we've what am I doing at the moment? I'm doing I've got that 100% loan to cost strategy, where we've taken the equitable charge. So we're still scaling with that, doing a lot of those. I've got quite a few turn buy to lets at the moment, where we're looking for HMO, good HMO valuations, you know, like 10 to 14% yield, very strong yield. But in the North East, North West, we need lenders that are going to fulfill that demand, that are going to be great for kind of satisfying that commercial vow. So doing a lot of that, I'm doing revolving facility for high net worth client. I've got four and a half mil mortgage going through, so it's a little bit bitty at the moment. I haven't got loads of development bigger stuff trying up last year where kind of lenders shut for two, three weeks. I'm just trying to get that going. There's a lot of light refurb might be interesting for me to show you guys the light refurb products. Actually, I will show you, just to see what you could do. Funding the works, maybe, and see if you can get a higher net day one that, because that will be helpful. So because I'm doing a lot of that, one of my big introducers is just constantly sending me clients, and so the higher net day one, yeah. So I'm currently sending them to mint, because I'm doing a lot of light reverb with them, and I get they're showing more point eight, 5% 2% proc, 2% arrangement fee. I always charge 1% brokerage, but we're doing like, nine month term. The works are like six to eight weeks. Is contracted out by the saucer. He's got, like, a team of professional, I think he's got five contracting firms so that he's a proper professional gross,

Speaker 1  
I assume, 80% gross or something. We're

Arose Finance  
trying to get as high as possible as we can. So so clients I have are trying to purchase them. They're BMV. They're generally BMV, but the gdv typically twice what the purchase price is, and they're spending, yeah, well, here's the thing, they're spending like 20 30k on the refurb. So don't know if that's going to fit your size, just

Speaker 1  
beyond the one that. Yeah, we'd probably go the 80% net on that. It's under the 50k

Arose Finance  
Uh huh. Okay, be interesting to see, because the aggregate so I've got, I've got one at the moment, the purchase price is 81,000 Okay, refurbs, 44 grand. Gdvs, 225, so,

Unknown Speaker  
yeah, a bit small for us, under

Arose Finance  
2k isn't that? With that particular source. All the deals are very small. They're like, small little clips. They're nice, like volume business

Speaker 1  
tickets. We can do multiple so I'll get around some of the ones from up north. Is we could do multiple deals, multiple securities, on one deal and on one title as well. So if they're purchasing free, or they've got another buy to let or two to throw in as well. We'll just do max lend off of that altogether. Then obviously has got to complete at the same time. But just be one deal, one offer, two free valves.

Arose Finance  
Makes sense. Got it? Okay, that can help but min loan size 200 for the light refurb stuff so well noted. Yeah, thanks so much for your time. That's

Unknown Speaker  
right. Sounds good. Have a good one. Give us a shout if you get in. Yeah,

Arose Finance  
you too. Yeah, we do. I'll keep you in mind. Anyways, we got each other on WhatsApp anyway. So voice note back and forth. But yeah, I will catch you soon. Have a good one. Cheers girls, thanks so much. Ryan, Speak to you soon. Bye, Bye.
